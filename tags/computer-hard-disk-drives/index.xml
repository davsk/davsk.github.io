&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The evidence provided consisted of duplicates of two hard disk drives, one from a laptop and one from a desktop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first step was to verify the digital signature of the discovery. Instead we determined that the evidence had been altered while in police custody.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step was to recover and identify files on the hard disk drives. The file information was transferred to a database and filtered using simple sql commands to identify potentially troublesome files and to explain why certain files were not relevant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to testify in this case that the hard disk drive had been altered while in police custody and on cross examination I explained that the access time on a particular file selected by the prosecutor indicated that it had not been accessed or viewed on that computer.&lt;/p&gt;

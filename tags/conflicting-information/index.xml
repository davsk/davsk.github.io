&lt;h4 id=&#34;using-computer-graphics-to-tell-the-story:2ea5b58990a4ea9bf957e359fae9bad0&#34;&gt;Using computer graphics to tell the story.&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young drug addict had been accused of shooting his unlicensed pharmaceutical dealer in the back of the head with a .38 Special while testing his wares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He claimed it was an accident, must have been a ricochet when he tripped and fell with the pistol they had been target shooting with while drunk and stoned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job was to convert the 5/16” in the coroner’s report to a decimal format and compare it with the .357” in the ballistics report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next problem was to present the information in the most effective way. I used a copy of the photograph of the hole in the skull to place concentric overlays of different diameters. I also created a clear film overlay with a typical picture of a bullet before and after impact . Placing the overlay over the copy of the picture allows for a direct comparison of relative size of the bullet, the hole, and the coroner’s report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the exhibit is documented in the newspaper article on the  LawAdvocateOnline.com website.&lt;/p&gt;

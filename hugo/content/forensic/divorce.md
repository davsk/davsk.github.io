The discovery in this case was over 2000 pages of financial information.

We set up a laptop computer and scanner in the library of the opposing counsel and a few hours later, all of the documents had been scanned into the computer.

By the following morning, the documents had been OCRed, indexed, and place on CD.

By the following Monday, the documents had been identified and a missing documents list had been prepared.

The resulting CD was then used to distribute information to financial experts.

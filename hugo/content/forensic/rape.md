### Computer forensic tools cannot reveal what is not there and cannot conceal what is there.
***
The evidence provided consisted of duplicates of two hard disk drives, one from a laptop and one from a desktop. 

The first step was to verify the digital signature of the discovery. Instead we determined that the evidence had been altered while in police custody.

The next step was to recover and identify files on the hard disk drives. The file information was transferred to a database and filtered using simple sql commands to identify potentially troublesome files and to explain why certain files were not relevant.

I had to testify in this case that the hard disk drive had been altered while in police custody and on cross examination I explained that the access time on a particular file selected by the prosecutor indicated that it had not been accessed or viewed on that computer.

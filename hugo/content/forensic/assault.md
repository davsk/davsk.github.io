#### Scaled computer modeling to set the scene
***
A request was made for an illustrative exhibit, a jail house door complete with cuff port.

I take a picture of the door and make some measurements.

I prepared a drawing of the door using a CAD program listing all of the dimensions.

I then built the lightweight wooden jailhouse door as a representational illustrative exhibit.

The door was then delivered to the court house on the day of trial for use by the defense attorney.
